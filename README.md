# Shadow Theme for StepMania 3.95 and OpenITG

## About

The Shadow Theme is a StepMania 3.95/OpenITG compatible theme for the In The Groove (ITG) community.

This is by no means a "good" theme, but I put a lot of time and energy into building it years ago, and learned a fair bit about design and programming from it. I eventually moved on to helping out with the ITG 3 Theme, so definitely check that out as well. https://github.com/openitg/itg3theme) 

The Shadow Theme is based on GRIM.657's Shadow Theme, and has many custom and backported features from the ITG 3 Theme. I've made a few improvements to it and fixed any major compatibility issues before making it public, so hopefully you'll have an enjoyable experience.

If you encounter a game breaking issue, feel free to report it and I'll see if I can fix it.
