# Shadow Theme for StepMania 3.95 and OpenITG

This is by no means a "good" theme, but I put a lot of time and energy into building it years ago, and learned a lot of about design and scripting/coding from it. I eventually moved on to helping out with the ITG 3 Theme, so definitely check that out as well (https://github.com/openitg/itg3theme). 

For whatever reason, a handful of people are still interested in it, so I'm finally making it public. I dusted it off and made a few updates to fix any major compatibility issues, so hopefully you'll have an enjoyable experience. If you encounter a game breaking issue, feel free to report it and I'll see if I can fix it.
