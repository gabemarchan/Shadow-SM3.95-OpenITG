# Shadow Theme for StepMania 3.95 and OpenITG

## About

The Shadow Theme is a StepMania 3.95/OpenITG compatible theme for the In The Groove (ITG) community.

This is by no means a "good" theme, but an interesting one with a few fun features and easter eggs. I put a lot of time and energy into building it years ago, and learned a bit about design and programming from it. I eventually moved on to working on the ITG 3 Theme, so definitely check that one out as well. https://github.com/openitg/itg3theme 

The Shadow Theme is based on GRIM.657's Shadow Theme, and has many custom and backported features from the ITG 3 Theme. I've made a few improvements to it and fixed any major compatibility issues before making it public, so hopefully you'll have an enjoyable experience.


## Supported Versions of StepMania

The Shadow Theme is compatible with older releases from the official StepMania project, and current releases of the OpenITG project.

**Compatible Releases**<br>
✅ StepMania 3.95<br>
✅ OpenITG<br>


**Incompatible**<br>
❌ StepMania 5 (e.g. StepMania 5.0.12, 5.1-b2, 5.2)<br>
❌ Much older versions of StepMania (e.g. StepMania 3.9)<br>
❌ Forks of older versions of StepMania/OpenITG (e.g. NotITG)<br>


## Installing the Shadow Theme

Place these theme files into a folder named `shadow` inside of your StepMania/OpenITG `Themes` folder. Your folder structure should be &nbsp;`/Themes/shadow/{GitHub Files}`

It requires the "default" and "fallback" theme folders that come pre-installed with StepMania/OpenITG in order to function.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of the Shadow Theme and not using Git to sync files, then fully delete the old Shadow folder first.  **Do not merge the new folder into the old.**


## Language Support

The Shadow Theme has support for:

  * English


## Aspect Ratio Support

The Shadow Theme is designed to be usable at resolutions as low as 640x480 and still look crisp and clean up to 1280×1024. It supports the following screen aspect ratios:

  * <strong>4:3</strong> (CRT arcade monitors, older TVs and monitors)

The aspect ratio can be changed under *Display Settings*.


## Technical Support

If you encounter a game breaking issue, feel free to report it and I'll see if I can fix it.

I don't not plan on making any futher improvements or changes to this theme.
